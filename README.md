# ErrorViewer
### Idk I just wanted to learn more about ASP.NET MVC, JQuery, Bootstrap and EntityFramework.
This is my first time using ASP.NET MVC and EntityFramework.  
This project is _**not**_ fully finished and will probably never be but so far it works with at least csv. Feel free to inspire or something like that.  

## Screenshots:
### Overview:  
"Analyze" errors in databases, csv files and etc. (rn, only csv and counting errors works).

### Accounts:  
Manage accounts. Add, edit, block or remove accounts. There are 2 types: admins and not admins. Admins can add more admins and sources.
